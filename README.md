Jobsite Sentry is a leader in providing innovative video surveillance solutions for any outdoor area using our state of the art Mobile Surveillance Sentry Unit. Our award winning Jobsite Sentry Unit can be deployed on any outdoor site that would normally require the need to hire a manned security guard but for a third of the cost. Our Jobsite Sentry is always on, always watching, never takes a break, never falls asleep, and can be relied on to secure any remote outdoor job site using its state of the art Solar Powered Power and LTE Communication Abilities. Our App gives our customers FREE uncapped data access to the LIVE stream of every Jobsite Sentry so as to allow site managers the ability to remote manage sites during the day. Our Jobsite Sentry Monitoring Center takes over at night and on the weekends making sure that whatever movement is picked up by The Jobsite Sentry is immediately acted upon. We had more than 20 arrests in 2017 in one state alone.
